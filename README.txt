Advent Of Code 2019 Challenges - In Elixir
================================================================================

This is a project to learn Elixir by doing the advent of code challenges, the
objectve is learning the gist of the programming language by doing "pratical"
challenges instead of simple examples.

I also made a version of this same challenge in Ruby, you can find that here:

You can see the Advent of Code challenges here:

Running the challenges:
================================================================================

The challenges are located at the 'lib/' folder, you can run any of then using
the command 'elixir lib/dayXX/partXX.ex', replacing XX for the day/part you want
to run.

You can also install and run the linter by running 'mix deps.get' to install the
dependencies and 'mix credo --strict' to see the list of the problems (it should
not have any in the master branch)
